# week 1 state button  

## Project 
When pushing on the button the led lights on, when pushing back the led lights off

## Learned 

- Basic electronic circuits   
- Led needs resistor to avoid burning  
- Coding in c and upload arduino program   
- Arduino digital ports reading and writing   
- Button pull up resistor to avoid erratic behaviour[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxjerCHCEMg) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vnW4U5Vj0k)
